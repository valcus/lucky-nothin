# Lucky Nothin'

This is a game that my mom came up with to teach us some math.

### Basic Rules

- The goal of Lucky Nothin' is to end 10 rounds of play with a score as close to 0 as possible.
- The game is played with 6 dice (6d6 for the nerds).
- Each round you must roll 3 times (with 2 exceptions mentioned later).
- After each roll, whatever number is the most common must be locked for the remainder of the round.
- If there is more than one most common number (ex: three 5's and three 2's) you may choose which to lock.
- When dice are locked you do not roll those dice, but you roll all other dice.
- at the end of your 3 rolls, whichever dice are locked have their value added to your total score, and all other dice have their value subtracted from your total score.
- There are two scenarios that can end your turn early and also have special scoring rules.
- Rolling 1,2,3,4,5,6 ends your turn immediately and you may choose to add 21 or subtract 21 from your score that round.
- Rolling all matching numbers (2,2,2,2,2,2) ends your turn immediately and your total score is set to 0.
